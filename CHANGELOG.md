## Know issue

1. on vitest/globals conflicting with testing-lib/jest-dom when running for build/preview scripts. Solutions provided were not sufficient to keep both globals working properly. As a fix, `"skipLibCheck": true,` from `tsconfig.json` was changed to `false`, in order to keep running those scripts.
